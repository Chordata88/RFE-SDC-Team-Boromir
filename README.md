## Overview

Project Atelier is an dynamic and responsive web application that I built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). The application showcases a range of products to potential customers, and facilitates a seamless shopping experience.

This project met the goals of designing a retail portal to implement the following mentioned features:

## Product Detail

- Product information

  - The Product Detail page provides essential information about the product, including the rating, category, title, price, overview, and social media links. This allows customers to quickly and easily make an informed decision about whether the product meets their needs.

  - The currently selected product and the style selected for that product will be dynamically rendered inside this component

- Image gallery

  - The Image gallery provides a smooth experience when navigating through images. Allowing image expansion and dynamic zoom functionality.

  - Clicking the current image opens an expanded view covering the pages width. From there another click will activate the zoom functionality with smooth mouse tracking.

- Style Selector

  - This component will guide the customer through finding the style combo they like, and display that specific product style in the image gallery.

- Checkout Form

  - The checkout allows the user to select from available sizes,from there they select from available quantities, and finally add the product to their cart.

  - If the proper selections are not made you will be prompted to delete them before adding the item to your cart

## Related Items and Your Outfits

The Related Items & Your Outfits module will display two sets of Carousels with cards about the product. The first set, 'Related Items', will be a list of products determined internally, that are related to the product currently being shown in the overview. The second set, 'Your Outfits', will be a list custom created by the user with products which the user has added to the carousel themselves.

- Related Product
  - The related product list display products which have been associated with the current product by the company.
  - The product card itself will be clickable. Clicking the card will navigate to the detail page for that product.
  - The product card will also have a â˜† button, that opens up a modal.
    - Inside the modal will be a comparison of features with the clicked card, and current overview item.
- Your Outfit
  - The outfit list contain products which the user has selected to group together as an outfit.
  - the first card in this carousel is a custom card button, and when clicked will add the current overview product.
  - Each card is stored in the user's local storage, to ensure uniqueness and retains the list the reload.
  - Each card will have a a X button, that deletes the product from the users 'Your Outfits' list.

## Questions and Answers

The Questions & Answers module allows asking and answering of questions for the product selected. The module contains the following components:

- View questions

  - The section displays up to 4 questions and 2 answers per question. Questions only contain their question body and include helpfulness and report functionality.
  - Each answer includes the same functionality, with additional user and date information for the posted answer. If more than 2 answers exist, then a See More Answers button will appear that displays the remaining questions when clicked.
  - Clicking on the More Answered Questions button will expand the questions list to a scrollable list that includes the remaining questions.
  - Each question and it's corresponding answers can be marked as helpful by clicking Yes. This will increase the helpfulness count of the respective question or answer by 1. Questions and answers can be reported by clicking on report which will mark them as reported in the system.

- Search for a question

  - The search bar in the section allows searching for specific questions. The typed text will be matched against the question body and return any matching results. Clearing the search bar will return the questions list to the original questions.

- Asking a question

  - If a question is not found in the list, a new one can be asked by clicking the Add a Question button. This will bring up a modal from with 3 fields: question body, nickname, and email. All 3 fields are required and the cannot be submitted unless they are filled out.

- Answering a question

  - Each question has an Add Answer button that will display a form modal for the question to be answered.
  - This modal consists of 3 fields: answer body, nickname, and email. These 3 fields are required and must be filled out before submitting.
  - An optional photo is allowed to be uploaded by clicking on the Upload Photo button. Up to 5 photos can be selected.

This component will extend the ability to view and search questions, ask questions, answer questions and provide feedback on questions about the current product.
